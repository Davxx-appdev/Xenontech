Bookmarks Page: This page displays a list of user-bookmarked schools. It includes a search bar for quick navigation, making it easy to find and manage bookmarked items.



School Details Page: Users can view in-depth information about a specific school, including the schoolâ€™s plan, visit frequency, pool hours, and current usage of hours. Users can also add notes and bookmark the school using a star icon for quick future access.



Staff Directory Page: A searchable directory of staff members, with details such as name, role, and contact information. Clicking on a staff member provides more detailed information, making it easy for users to find the right person to connect with.



Video Library Page: The searchable video library organizes instructional videos by title and date, allowing users to easily find and watch relevant resources. Videos are related to tasks or important organizational resources.

Login Page: The app's login page uses Google Sign-In but restricts access to users with @xenontech.com.au email addresses. This ensures secure access to the app for authorized personnel only.
